## Building

If you want to build this flatpak platform locally, you will need the flathub flatpak repository installed. You can
follow instructions for that [here](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

Next you will need:

- A lot of space (~ 15 Gb)
- `flatpak-builder`
- `git`

And finally, you can run this command to build and install:

```sh
flatpak-builder --force-clean --install-deps-from=flathub --ccache --repo=elementary --install builddir ./io.elementary.Sdk.json
```

## Publishing

This repository has CI/CD setup. Building and publishing is handled automatically with the help of some amazing GitHub
actions, and takes no human interaction.

### Daily

Every push to the `main` branch will start a build and publish it to our repository under the `daily` branch. This
branch is build frequently and is **not recommended for production**.

### Stable

**TODO**
